# Spring Boot Bug Tracker
The Spring Boot Bug Tracker is a web application built with the Spring Boot framework that allows software development teams to track and manage bugs throughout the development process. With this tool, teams can easily report, assign, and track bugs, as well as collaborate on solutions and track progress over time. The Spring Boot Bug Tracker is easy to use and customizable, making it a valuable tool for any software development team.

## How does it work?

The application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authorization, and users are assigned roles and authorities to control their access to different features.
 
Users can register, login, and reset passwords using the application. Once logged in, users can report bugs, view existing bugs, and collaborate with other team members to find solutions. The application also allows users to create and manage projects (Project Leaders feature), and view a dashboard that provides an overview of the status of all bugs and projects.

To ensure security, the application uses pre-authorization for certain methods, forbidding certain actions based on a user's role and permissions. All data is stored in a database, including information about bugs, projects, and users.

## Issues

The Issues tab of the Bug Tracker provides an overview of all reported bugs, along with detailed information about their classification, status, severity, and assigned user.

The main table displays a list of all reported bugs, including the bug name, description, classification, status, severity, project, assigned user, and creation date. Users can click on a bug to view additional details and make edits or updates as necessary.

Project Leaders have access to additional functionality, including the ability to edit all bugs, assign, unassign and reassign users to work on bugs, and delete bugs. This ensures that project leaders can manage bugs effectively and ensure that they are resolved in a timely manner.

Users who are not Project Leaders have more limited access, and can only edit and delete bugs that they have created and whose status is still NEW. Once a bug's status changes (e.g. due to being assigned to a user), only project leaders can edit it.

This access control ensures that users can view and edit bugs that are relevant to their work, while maintaining the necessary levels of security and access control. Overall, the Issues tab provides a comprehensive view of all reported bugs, along with the ability to manage and resolve them efficiently.

## Notifications

The Notifications tab of the Bug Tracker provides an easy way for users to stay informed about important events in the application. Notifications are sent automatically during key events, such as when a bug is reported (with notifications sent to the project leader), or when a project is deleted (with notifications sent to participants who will be unassigned).

In addition, users receive notifications when their bugs are edited or deleted by project leaders, ensuring that everyone stays up-to-date on any changes to their assigned tasks.

Overall, the Notifications tab helps ensure that all users are informed and engaged, and that everyone is working together effectively to resolve bugs and improve the application.
