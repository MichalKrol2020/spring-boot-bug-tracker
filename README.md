# Spring Boot Bug Tracker
The Spring Boot Bug Tracker is a web application built with the Spring Boot framework that allows software development teams to track and manage bugs throughout the development process. With this tool, teams can easily report, assign, and track bugs, as well as collaborate on solutions and track progress over time. The Spring Boot Bug Tracker is easy to use and customizable, making it a valuable tool for any software development team.

## How does it work?

The application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authorization, and users are assigned roles and authorities to control their access to different features.
 
Users can register, login, and reset passwords using the application. Once logged in, users can report bugs, view existing bugs, and collaborate with other team members to find solutions. The application also allows users to create and manage projects (Project Leaders feature), and view a dashboard that provides an overview of the status of all bugs and projects.

To ensure security, the application uses pre-authorization for certain methods, forbidding certain actions based on a user's role and permissions. All data is stored in a database, including information about bugs, projects, and users.
